## Preview area

The preview area is located to the right of the tab bar and is intended for viewing a project while
editing it.

![Camtasia - preview area](/images/blog/camtasia-preview-area.png)

* 1: Player
* 2: Buttons

The preview area includes two subsections:

* (1) **Player**. The player is used to view the editing results.
* (2) **Buttons area**. The buttons are used to control the player (e.g., start and stop the preview).
In addition, the **Properties** button allows you to view and edit the properties of the object you
select on the timeline.

* 1: Visual properties
* 2: Audio properties
* 3: Cursor properties

The preview area can be detached from the main window by selecting the **Detach Canvas** option on the
menu bar above.

You can change the size of the detached window by dragging its borders or by selecting the desired scale
in the drop-down menu. To attach the window back, select the **Attach Canvas** option on the menu bar.

## Timeline

In the lower part of the window, you can see the timeline that shows the sequence of clips in the project.
The timeline can contain various objects:
* Video tracks
* Audio tracks
* Tracks for placing various effects (transitions, notes, etc.)

![Camtasia - timeline](/images/blog/camtasia-timeline.png)

Each of the objects can be contained in the timeline many times (for example, several audio tracks) and edited
separately from the other objects.

The toolbar above the timeline allows you to perform different actions.

![Camtasia - timeline toolbar](/images/blog/camtasia-timeline-toolbar.png)

* 1: Buttons for canceling and return actions
* 2: Buttons for working with the buffer (cut, copy, paste)
* 3: Button to split a clip
* 4: Button / slider to change the scale of the timeline
* 5: Slider to change the track height
* 6: Button to add a new track / track with markers

If necessary, you can lock objects on the timeline to prevent accidental actions on them. To lock, click the
lock icon (**Lock track**) on the corresponding track. After that, the lock icon is highlighted in white, and
the track itself is displayed on a shaded background.

You can also exclude a track from the preview and the final video by clicking on the **Disable track** button
above the lock icon.

Using the playback slider, you can move quickly through your video. To do this, left-click on the slider and
move it to the desired location on the timeline. To the right of the slider, the frame (time in the video clip)
in which the slider is currently located is displayed.
