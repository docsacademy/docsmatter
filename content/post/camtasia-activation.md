Once Camtasia is installed, the program shortcut is added to the Windows start menu (Start - TechSmith - Camtasia)
and to the desktop (if you haven't changed the default settings). To start Camtasia, double-click the shortcut or
select the corresponding entry in the start menu. The program activation window is shown.

The program activation window is displayed. Here you can either enter your existing license (**Enter Software Key**)
or select the option to use the trial version (**Sign In to Start Trial**). The trial version is valid for 30 days and
has the same set of features as the activated version. The only limitation is that a watermark is displayed on your
created videos.
