> In this post, we continue exploring the process of setting everything up for recording a
screencast.

## Settings for configuring the recording devices

Camtasia Recorder can perform the following actions while recording:

* Record the selected area on your monitor screen.
* Record the image from the built-in or an external webcam.
* Record voice guidance.
* Record sounds played back by the system.

You can configure options for performing these actions in the **Recorded inputs** area of the
Camtasia Recorder window.

We will use the following settings to record our screencast:

* The webcam is off. If the webcam is disabled, the button displays an icon with a red cross on it,
and the **Camera off** entry is shown below the icon. By clicking this icon, you can activate the
webcam for recording. In this case, the red cross mark changes to a green checkmark, and a preview window
is displayed next to the button.

* The microphone is on. When the microphone is on, a green checkmark is displayed at the microphone button
and the **Audio on** entry is shown below the button. By clicking the check mark next to the button, you can
open the list of recording devices and select the desired microphone from it.<br />
To the right of the microphone selection button is a slider with a color bar for adjusting the audio volume.
Usually, it is enough to place the slider in the middle of the scale for normal sound. In this case, the
scale should turn yellow and green during when you speak.

* System sounds are disabled. In our screencast, we do not plan to record system sounds. Therefore, make sure
that the **Record system audio** option in the drop-down list next to the microphone is deactivated (no check
mark is displayed next to the option).

## Recording start/stop settings

By default, before the recording starts

* A window is displayed informing you that to stop the recording process, you must press the F10 key.
* The countdown begins.

![Camtasia - information window with the countdown](/images/blog/camtasia-countdown-window.png)

Let's deactivate the countdown so that the recording starts immediately after you click the record button.
To do this:

1.	Click **Tools** - **Options** in the record settings window.

    * The **Tools Options** window opens.

2. Click the **Program** tab. 

![Camtasia - tab for deactivating the countdown](/images/blog/camtasia-tab-for-deactivating-countdown.png)

3. Deactivate the **Show countdown before recording** option.

4. Click the **OK** button.

In this window, you can also configure other options to start/stop the recording (for example, enable the
**Hide preview window after recording is stopped**)  or select to show the Camtasia Recorder window once
the recording has started (**Minimize recorder**). We'll leave all other settings as default.

## Entering the file name manually

By default, Camtasia automatically saves the video file and generates for it a name like **Rec MM-DD-GY**
after the recording is complete (for example, **Rec 08-25-2021** if the recording was made on August 25, 2021).
To be able to enter the name of the video file manually, do the following:

1. Click **Tools** - **Options** in the Camtasia Recorder.

    * A window containing the recording settings opens.

2. Make sure that the **General** tab is selected and click the **File options** button in the **Saving** area.

    * A window with settings for saving recorded video files opens.

3. Activate the **Ask for file name** option.

![Camtasia - activating the manual entering of file names](/images/blog/camtasia-entering-file-name-manually.png)

4. Click the **OK** button.

    * The settings are saved.
    * Now, when the recording is finished, a dialog box is displayed where you must enter the file name and the path
    to the destination folder.
