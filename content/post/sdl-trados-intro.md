> This post opens a series of blog posts dedicated to SDL Trados Studio, one of the most popular computer-assisted
translations tools (CAT tools) used to quickly and efficiently translate texts from one language to another.

[**NEXT POST**](/post/sdl-trados-cat-overview/)

Step by step using practical examples, you will learn how to perform the following actions:

* Install SDL Trados Studio on your computer.
* Customize the application interface to meet your needs.
* Use the basic functions in SDL Trados Studio to prepare and translate texts.
* Create and populate terminology databases.
* And much more.

## SDL Trados Studio version

All exercises are performed in SDL Trados Studio 2021. If you are working with a different version, some of
the application options may slightly differ from those described in this tutorial.

## Who this tutorial is for

This tutorial will be of interest to beginners who have no or little experience using SDL Trados Studio. Step
by step, you will master its main functions, learn how to translate files in various formats (Word, Power-Point,
Excel etc.), and get acquainted with the SDL MultiTerm terminology management module.

Theoretical knowledge is given in the tutorial to a minimum extent, as the main goal is to show in practice
how to work with SDL Trados Studio and what functions can be used in what situations. 

## Prior knowledge

I assume that you have experience using the Microsoft Windows operating system - that is, you know how to run
programs, save files, and perform other basic operations. Experience with computer-assisted translation
management systems is not required.

## Used conventions

This tutorial uses the following formatting:

* The names of buttons, fields, functions are in bold. For example: Click the **Create project** button.
* Additional information or a note is marked by horizontal lines and a special icon.
