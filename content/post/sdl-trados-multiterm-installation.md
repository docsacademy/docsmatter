> **SDL MultiTerm Convert and SDL MultiTerm Widget** <br />
SDL MultiTerm Convert is used to convert terminology databases of different formats (TBX, Excel, etc.) into a format
supported by SDL MultiTerm.
The SDL MultiTerm Widget is a desktop widget that allows you to view the meaning of terms.
Working with SDL MultiTerm Convert and SDL MultiTerm Widget is not covered in this book.

* A window opens where you can select the folder for installing MultiTerm.
