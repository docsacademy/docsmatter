a callout to your screencast, see this [post](/post/camtasia-managing-callouts-1/).

## Changing the callout color and transparency

Our callout is white and gets a bit lost in the background of the browser window. Let's make it stand out by
changing its color:

1.	Select the callout in the preview window, if it is not already selected.

2. Click the **Properties** button located on the right side under the preview window.

* The **Properties** window opens.

3. At the top of the window, click the tab with the ![](/images/blog/camtasia/camtasia-callout-icon.png) icon.

* A window for editing the callout properties opens. We want to change two properties: color and opacity
(the latter allows us to make the callout transparent and see the address bar behind it).

1: callout color<br />
2: callout opacity

4. In the **Fill** field, click on the arrow to the right of the white rectangle and choose the desired color.

5. In the **Opacity** field, drag the slider to the middle of the line (50%).

* Now our callout should be more visible in the preview window.

## Changing the callout text

Now let's edit the default text of the callout and the color it is displayed in:

1. Double-click on the callout text (that is, on the **ABC** letters).

* The text is highlighted in light gray.

2. Enter the text: **Address bar**.

3. Double-click the entered text to highlight it.

4. Click the ![](/images/blog/camtasia/camtasia-edit-text-icon.png) tab in the callout properties.

* A window for editing the properties of the callout text opens.

1: tab for editing text <br />
2: field for changing the text color <br />
3: field for changing the font properties

5. In the **Font** field, click on the arrow to the right of the light gray rectangle and select the desired color
(e.g., black).

* The text is now displayed in the selected color.

6. To make the text stand out even more, you can click on the arrow text next to **Regular** and select **Bold**
from the dropdown list.
