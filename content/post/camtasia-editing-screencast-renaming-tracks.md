By default, the tracks in the video clip are automatically named **Track 1**, **Track 2**, etc. To make it more convenient to work with
the tracks, let's rename them as follows:

* **Main**: This track contains the video and audio of our screencast.
* **Logo**: This track contains our logo.

To change the name of a track, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the name of the track you want to change.

* The track context menu opens.

2. Click the **Rename Track** item.

* The track name is highlighted and becomes editable.

> You can also double-click on the track to make it available for editing.

3.	Type the desired name (e.g., **Main** or **Logo**) and press Enter.

* The entered name is saved for the track.
