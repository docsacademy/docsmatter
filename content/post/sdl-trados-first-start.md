> In this post, you'll learn about the steps you need to perform when starting SDL Trados
Studio for the first time after installation.

[**PREVIOUS POST**](/post/sdl-trados-multiterm-installation/) **< || >** [**NEXT POST**](/post/sdl-trados-interface-1/)

Once SDL Trados Studio is installed, a program shortcut is added to the Windows start menu
(**Start** - **SDL Trados Studio 2021** - **SDL Trados Studio 2021**) and to the desktop.
To start SDL Trados Studio, double-click the shortcut or select the corresponding entry in
the **Start** menu. This will open the **SDL Trados Studio Setup** wizard.

![SDL Trados Studio - initial setup - step 1](/images/blog/sdl-trados-initial-setup-1.png)

Clicking the **Next** button opens the step of the wizard with information about the user.

![SDL Trados Studio - initial setup - step 2](/images/blog/sdl-trados-initial-setup-2.png)

Specify information about the user who will be working in SDL Trados Studio:

* Enter the user name and email address in the **Name** and **Email Address** fields. This
information is used to handle project files (for example, to know to which address packages
with project files should be sent/received and who will be listed as the sender). You can
also specify your phone number for the contact in the corresponding field.

* In the **TM User ID** field, you can enter the user name that will be used to work with
the translation memory segments. When creating a new segment or editing an existing one,
this name will be shown in the corresponding fields. If you omit the user name, the Windows
user name will be used.

* In the **Description** field, you can enter any additional information about yourself,
such as the role you play (interpreter, manager, etc.).

After clicking the **Next** button, the **User Profile** window opens.

![SDL Trados Studio - initial setup - step 3](/images/blog/sdl-trados-initial-setup-3.png)

In this step, you need to select the user profile you want to use in SDL Trados Studio.
If you previously used versions of SDLX or SDL Trados, you can select the appropriate
profiles from the dropdown menu. This will allow you to use the shortcuts and translation
settings that were used in those versions. Otherwise, select the **Default** profile.

If SDLX or SDL Trados is selected as a profile, the behavior of some functions may be
slightly different from the behavior described here.

In the **Customer Experience** step, select whether you want to participate in the
software quality improvement program and click **Next**.

In the last step, you will be prompted to load sample files. We will use our own sample
files, so it is recommended that the **Load sample files** option at initial startup is
deactivated.

![SDL Trados Studio - initial setup - step 5](/images/blog/sdl-trados-initial-setup-5.png)

Clicking the **Finish** button finishes the program setup and closes the wizard.

## Activating the program

Once the initial setup is complete, the program activation window appears.

![SDL Trados Studio - activation window](/images/blog/sdl-trados-activation-window.png)

Here you can enter your existing license or select the option to use the test version. The
test version is valid for 30 days and has the same set of features as the activated program
version.

The following steps are required for activation:

1. Make sure that you have an active Internet connection.

2. In the **Activate SDL Trados Studio 2021** window, click the **Activate** button.

* A window opens where you can enter the activation code.

3.	Copy the license number and paste it into the **Activation Code** field.

4. Click the **Activate** button.

![SDL Trados Studio - entering licese](/images/blog/sdl-trados-entering-license.png)

* The program is activated.

* A window is displayed to confirm that the activation was successful.

If online activation is not possible, you can use the offline activation feature by
clicking on the **Alternative Activation Options** link. More information about offline
activation can be found on the SDL website.

The steps described above only need to be performed once. The next time you start the
program, you will immediately see the **SDL Trados Studio Welcome** screen.
