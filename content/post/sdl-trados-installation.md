Once you have decided on which version of SDL Trados Studio you want to use, you need to
download the installation files. You can use one of the following ways to get the installation files:

* Purchase a valid license
* Download a trial version

In the following, we assume that you have purchased a valid license for SDL Trados Studio.

> **Free Trial Version**<br />
There is a 30-day free trial version of SDL Trados Studio. At the end of this period, you
need to buy a license for further work with the program. The trial version has full
functionality but does not contain the SDL MultiTerm application.

After purchasing the license, you will be prompted to create an account on the SDL website.
An account is required to access your personal member area. Clicking the **Products & Plans - Downloads**
tab in your personal area opens the list of all installation files currently available for download.

To download the desired files, click the **Download** button in the appropriate sections of SDL
Trados Studio and SDL MultiTerm (we'll install this application later). Save the files to a folder
on your local computer.

## Installation procedure

First, let's install the SDL Trados Studio application. Follow these steps:

> **Changing the computer's configuration** <br />
If after starting the installation you get a message that SDL Trados Studio wants to change the
computer's configuration, allow the changes by clicking **Yes**.

1. Go to the folder with the SDL Trados Studio installation file (it's usually called
**SDLTradosStudio20XX_XXX_XXXXXX.exe**) and double-click it.<br />

* The SDL Trados Studio installation wizard is launched.

2. Click the **Accept** button.

* The installation files are unpacked.
* The wizard checks if the required components are installed on the local computer.
* Microsoft .NET 4.8 runtime environment is required to work with SDL Trados Studio 2021.
If it is not installed on your computer, the installation file will be downloaded to your
computer (you must have an active Internet connection) and installed automatically. In this
case, you will see a window with the license agreement that you should confirm by clicking
the **Accept** button.

* The progress of the installation is displayed in a special window.
* Once the installation is complete, a confirmation window is displayed.
